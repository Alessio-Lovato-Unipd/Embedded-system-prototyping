Embedded System Prototyping course assignment. We have to design a pcb using this specs:

Build an indoor sensor based on an ESP32-S2-WROOM-I module with WiFi communication 

The sensor should send the temperature to a MQTT server and sleep between measurements. 

What needs to be included in the design:

- Power regulation suitable for low power sleep modes

- Micro USB port for programming and power. (should be located at the bottom of the board to face the matching hole in the box for the USB cable)

- Battery connector for standalone use.

- Battery charge circuit (Li-Ion)

- PCB size and mounting holes should be according to box specification
